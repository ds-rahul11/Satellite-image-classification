Satellite-image-classification

Model used: Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)
  A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, 
  assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one 
  from the other. 
dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/crawford/deepsat-sat4

Accuracy of the model is found to be 98.92999999999999

Use kaggle notebook or jupyter notebook with GPU integrated for faster image classification
